# Building Reusable Code with Rust [Video]
This is the code repository for [Building Reusable Code with Rust [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-reusable-code-rust-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788399524), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Rust is the ideal language for writing safe, correct code in a way that won't make you pull your hair out. This course will teach you how to build reusable Rust code so that you can stop copy-pasting code. Write one code that can adapt to many different usages. 
You will reuse code by using advanced features like Traits, Generics and Macros. You will work with different forms of code reuse, loops, map, filter and fold to save time and resources. Achieve higher level reuse without sacrificing run-time performance. Organize your code into modules and crates to publish them to crates.io.
By the end of the course you will be able to avoid code duplication to write clean reusable code
